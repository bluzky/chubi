## Directory structure explain

- `theme.ex` is the place where you define your theme info
- `static` directory contain your theme assests
- `template` : you put your template files here
- `view`: In Phoenix, you can define function in view and use them in template instead of writing too much logic code in the template file.

## Naming convention

`Phoenix` apply a strict rule for naming file and directory that you have to follow when create a new one.

There is one `_view.ex` file for each directory in `templates` directory. For example: you create a directory name `test` in `template` directory, you have to create a view name `test_view.ex` in `views` directory. And all functions which is defined in `test_view.ex` can be used directly in any template file that is put in `test` directory.
