# Getting started

[TOC]

## 1. Setup environment

If you have Elixir developing environment on your machine, you can skip this step.

In this guide, I use [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com) to manage version for Erlang, Elixir, Postgres .... You can secify version for each plugin. If you have any application installed, you can skip in and move to the next.

1. Install `asdf`. Follow instruction [here](https://asdf-vm.com/#/core-manage-asdf-vm)

2. Install `postgresql`

   Follow instruction [here](https://github.com/smashedtoatoms/asdf-postgres) to install postgres plugin then run following command

   ```shel
    asdf install postgres 10.5
    asdf global postgres 10.5
   ```

3. Install `Erlang`

   Follow instruction [here](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang) to install erlang plugin then run following commands

   ```shell
    asdf install erlang 22.1
    asdf global erlang 22.1
   ```

4. Install `Elixir`

   ```shell
   asdf plugin-add elixir https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-elixir.git
   asdf install elixir 1.9.4
   asdf global elixir 1.9.4
   ```



## 2. Install Chubi

1. Clone project with `git@github.com:bluzky/chubi.git`
2. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
3. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
4. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
