# Configuration

There are 2 type of configuration: application configuration and site params.

## Application configuration

Application configuration is store in `config/dev.exs` for dev environment and `config/prod.secret.exs` for production environment.

### Database config

You can config connection setting to your database here. This is default config for develop environment

```elixir
config :chubi, Chubi.Repo,
  username: "postgres",
  password: "postgres",
  database: "chubi_dev",
  hostname: "localhost",
  pool_size: 10
```



### Admin login credential

This is configuration for your admin account. Change username and password to yours. Chubi use `Simple Auth` so there is no login page, just a pop up window for you to enter username and password.

```elixir
config :chubi,
  auth_config: [
    username: "admin",
    password: "123123",
    realm: "Hey! Log in to admin"
  ]
```
